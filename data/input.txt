*Partial Story*
```
I was a vet in Yorkshire. One day I received a call from Mrs Tompkin asking me to cut the beak (喙) of her budgie's (虎皮鹦鹉). l armed myself with a pair of clippers and stepped onto the narrow strip of pavement which separated the door from the road. A pleasant-looking red-haired woman answered my knock.
“I'm Mrs Dodds from next door,” she said. “I keep an eye on the old lady. She's over eighty and lives alone.”
She led me into the cramped little room. “Here's Mr Herriot coming to see Peter for you,” she said to the old woman who sat in a corner. Mrs Tompkin nodded and smiled, “Oh that's good. Poor little fella can hardly eat with its long beak and I'm worried about him. He's my only companion, you know.”
“Yes, I understand, Mrs Tompkin.” I looked at the cage by the window with the green budgie perched(栖息)inside. “These little birds can be wonderful company when they start chattering.” She laughed. “Yes, but it's a funny thing. Peter never has said that much. I think he's lazy! But I just like having him with me.”
“Of course you do,” I said, “but he certainly needs attention now.”
The beak was greatly overgrown, curving away down till it touched the feathers of the breast. I would be able to revolutionize his life with one quick snip from my clippers. The way I was feeling this job was right up my street.
I opened the cage door and slowly inserted my hand.
“Come on, Peter,” I wheedled(哄骗).As I lifted him out, I felt in my pocket with the other hand for the clippers. Then I stopped.
The tiny head was no longer poking cheekily from my fingers but had fallen loosely to one side. The eyes were closed. He was dead.
Mrs Dodds and I looked at each other in horror. When I turned my head towards Mrs Tompkin, I was surprised to see that she was still nodding and smiling.
I drew her neighbor to one side. “Mrs Dodds, how much does she see?”
“Oh, she's very short-sighted but she's right vain despite her age. Never would she wear glasses. She's hard of hearing，too.”
“Well, look,” I said. My heart was still pounding. “I just don't know what to do. If I tell her about this, the shock will be terrible. Anything could happen.”
Mrs Dodds nodded, stricken-faced. “Yes, you're right. She's that attached to the little thing.”

*Student's Writing*
```
I decided to do something for her instead of telling her the truth. I decided to wash dishes to relieve stress on housework. I walked into kicthen and did something   I could do. Mrs. Dodds smiled to me and expressed her great. I know that I still need to do something to make up for mistake. I went to bird shop to buy a new budgies and took it to Mrs. Dolds home. or Don't tell her truth.   I left with these words. I wished that Mrs. Tompkin could keep happy.

It was a long time before I went to see how Mrs Tompkin got along with the bird I bought for her. Fortunately, Mrs. Tompkin haven't figured out that the bird wasn't hers. She accompanied the bird happily and also called it as   Peter  . I felt sorry about her, but that was all I can do for her. It was a tragding that lonely old woman lost her only companion. I asked Mrs. Tompkin about how she felt recently, she added and smiled as well. I decided to recognize the occurrence of a previous environmental condition and to react accordingly.   I knowed that the bird is not Peter. But my   I still thank for you.   Mrs. Tomplin says. These words shocked me
